# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Client has requested the team generate a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using the supplied data located in the resources folder. Also, a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type (urban,suburban,rural) is to be provided for visualization.  An analysis is provided of how the data differs by city type and recomendations on how these differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.   

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Anaconda virtual environment Python Jupyterlab Pandas

## Results:
